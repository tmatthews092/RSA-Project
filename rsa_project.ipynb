    "RSA cryptosystem encrypts messages using modular exponentiation where the modulus is the product of two large primes. We use RSA today because modern computers are unable to quickly factorize large numbers. If done correctly, encrypted messages with 4096 bit long integers will not be broken for billions of years. However, Quantum Computers using [Shor’s algorithm](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) may change the landscape making RSA obsolete. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores and implements RSA through a series of methods, FME, EEA, Find_Public_Key_e, Find_Private_Key_d, Encode, and Decode. FME, fast modular exponentiation, illustrates how exponentiation with large numbers can be solved by squaring numbers instead. EEA, extended euclidean algorithm, calculates the greatest common divisor between two numbers and identifies the Bezout Coefficients, this method is the key to RSA. Find_Public_Key_e uses the Euclidean Algorithm facet of EEA to find public keys n and e given two primes. Find_Public_Key_d, calculates the private keys n and d give e and n. Encode  uses FME to encrypt string messages and decode uses FME to decrypt the encoded message we receive or construct. We will see that the combination of these methods can be used to independently enact each part of the RSA process. \n",
    "\n",
    "I went step-by-step to build this project, following the lectures and reading the textbook to implement each algorithm, decrypt and encrypt messages. At times difficult to follow, the lectures proved quite handy as Sriram gave guidance and clarity in building some of the more complex algorithms like EEA. To implement the Find Keys methods I turned to the textbook to understand the math behind how to calculate e and d. Encode and Decode were straightforward in definition in pages 299 and 301. Using the Piazza codes I was able to test my code and feel confident that I had constructed the methods correctly. For my custom code I decided to write a main method which calls specific methods for the user with prompts for prime integers, it even will generate primes for you.\n"

Convert_Binary_String converts an integer to it's binary value as a string. For instance, Convert_Binary_String(20) = '10100'. To find the binary for 20 we iterate over 20 divide it by 2 to find each bit in base 2. To find the exact bit, we use 20 modulo 2 and its subsequent quotients. We add those bits at the beginning of the array since those bits found are the least significant digit of the binary number. We then join them together as the return value for the method. To demonstrate that division and modulo work let's walkthrough converting 20 to binary.\n",

    "FME, put simply uses the parameters b, n, and m to find the value b<sup>n</sup> mod m. Why not use `b**n % m`, instead of Exponentiation by Squaring, because `b**n % m` is slow. Why it's slow is that the computating time for `b**n` for large numbers is signficant. For example, computing `3**(10**7)` takes ~2.5 seconds in Jupyter, however, once you increase `3**(10**8)` Jupyter takes ~1.5 minutes. Storing and computing huge numbers then taking the modulo is difficult for modern computers. Even when switching the values of b and n, we still see a significant slowdown in computation speed when numbers become very large. The drawbacks of `b**n % m` are why FME is used instead. Unlike `b**n % m`, FME is much quicker it uses a similar algorithm of Convert_Binary_String (see above description). Like in Convert_Binary_String where modulo and division are used to find each bit, FME uses these values to step through the number while calculating the exponential of `b**n` by squaring values: `result = (result * square) % mod` and `square = (square * square) % m`. In contrast to `b**n % m` FME uses these statements to square in increments rather than computing and storing massive exponentials."

    "The Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) calculates the GCD and Bezout coefficients for two positive integers a and b. To find the GCD we implement the same behavior from Eucldiean Algorithm (see above), however, to find the Bezout coefficients we have to understand Bezout's theorem first. Bezout's theorem states: $gcd(m,n) = sm + tn$, where s and t are the Bezout coefficients used to express the $gcd(m,n)$. For instance, to express $gcd(17,131) = 1$, we can use the linear combination, $(54, -7)$ ie the Bezout coefficients $gcd(17,131) = (54)17 + (-7)131 = 1$.\n",

    "What is essential about EEA is that we can use this logic to find the inverse d of e modulo (p-1)(q-1). This value d lets us decrypt messages that are sent to us. Additionally, we could use EEA, instead of  the Euclidean Algorithm in [Find_Public_Key_e](#find-public-key), since EEA returns the GCD as well as the Bezout coefficients. Let's now show how EEA can be used to find the inverse d of e modulo (p-1)(q-1), let's assume e = 3, p = 5, and q = 11, what number satisfies $(3*d)\\,mod\\,40 = 1$? We find $d=27, 81\\,mod\\,40 = 1$, therefore the inverse modulo is 27. Importantly, there is a relationship where the inverse of d modulo (p-1)(q-1) is $s\\,mod\\,(p-1)(q-1)$ meaning to find the inverse modulo of e modulo (p-1)(q-1), we can use $s$ from Bezout coefficients. However, $s$ can be negative we we use increment_by_mod to find the first positive number. So when EEA(3,40), returns (-13,1), -13 is $s$ so we add 40 to get d=27. This method is used in [Find_Private_Key_d](#find-private-key) to get d."

    "#### My approach\n",
    "What is RSA? As a software engineer, I've heard about RSA countless times. I even created an RSA hex key for a Salesforce organization to authorize a connection between our continuous integration software. However, I didn't fully understand the underlying concepts; I simply followed the steps. This reflects my journey as a self-taught software engineer, where I often find it challenging to deeply explore topics or grasp their significance. During this project, I finally had the opportunity to answer my questions and implement what I learned about RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing a full-time job while attending school can feel like burning the candle at both ends. To manage this challenge, I avoid thinking about everything at once, as it can become overwhelming. Instead, I prefer to take one step at a time. This mindset is how I approached the RSA project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base 2\n",
    "My first hurdle was converting a binary string. Although this wasn't essential for my work with RSA, I found it challenging to understand. I decided to break it down into smaller steps, which made it easier to grasp. I started by taking the modulo 2 of the integer to determine the value of the least significant bit. At first, I didn't understand why this method worked, so I took a closer look at the process. For example, when I calculate 20 % 2, the result is 0. I then divide 20 by 2, which gives me 10, and again perform 10 % 2 results in 0. But why does this happen? To clarify, let's consider the binary expansion of 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Binary Expansion  |\n",
    "|-----------------|\n",
    "| 20 = 2 * 10 + 0 |\n",
    "| 10 = 2 * 5  + 0 |\n",
    "| 5  = 2 * 2  + 1 |\n",
    "| 2  = 2 * 1  + 0 |\n",
    "| 1  = 2 * 0  + 1 |\n",
    "    \n",
    "The binary system is based on base 2, so we take the modulo 2 of that number. As we see two lines down, the number is then divided by 2. This is because binary uses base 2, which is why we divide by 2! It all makes sense now. This is generally how I tackle challenging questions: If it can be explained with math, then great! If not, I turn to the book. If it’s not in the book, I look online at reputable sources and make sure to cite them if I use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e\n",
    "The most challenging part of this project was identifying the value of e. The book defines e as an integer that is relatively prime to (p-1)*(q-1). Being relatively prime means that the greatest common divisor (gcd) between two numbers is 1. So we need to find $gcd(e, (p-1)*(q-1))$. In many cases, there are multiple values of e that satisfy this condition, which can be confusing. How can there be multiple options? Which one should I use? Is there a specific range? How can I tell if I have chosen incorrectly?\n",
    "\n",
    "I searched the textbook for answers but couldn't find a definitive explanation. Eventually, I turned to Wikipedia’s article on RSA, which mentioned that $1 < e < λ(n)$, where is $λ(n) = lcm(p − 1, q − 1)$. Therefore e must be $1 < e < lcm(p - 1, q - 1)$.  I also attempted to read about the Carmichael function but felt overwhelmed. I couldn't understand why the least common multiple was used as the upper limit. However, this gave me a boundary to work within. Looking back at the book “find an e relatively prime to (p-1)*(q-1)”, find being the imperative word. It is clear, choose an e that works. Using a cooking metaphor, e is like a recipe, there are many you can choose from, but you must choose which one is right based on the ingredients you have in your kitchen.\n",

    "#### ϖµSSғѶϾғЙSПʵ, Hello World!\n",
    "Exchanging codes was a great way to test my code to ensure my encoding and decoding methods were working. In my initial attempt to verify my logic, I input the public keys n and e into my Find_Private_Key_d method. However, the result did not match other students' private keys, I noticed that my d value was negative. This reminded me of a quiz we had taken a week prior, which included a question about whether we should add the modulo if the inverse is negative. The answer was yes, so I wrote a helper method increment_by_mod which fixed the issue. I also wanted to exchange an encrypted emoji message with students but continued to get Unicode mismatches, which when this happens can look like ϖµSSғѶϾғЙSПʵ or any form of the like. With fortitude in heart, I did some research and discovered our RSA solution does not support UTF-8, which is [required for emojis](#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47716217/converting-emojis-to-unicode-and-vice-versa-in-python-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools\n",
    "Working on my RSA project I found the lectures, textbooks, and online resources like Wikipedia to be the most helpful. While I think it could have been helpful, going to office hours would have been nice to better understand the structure of the project and what is expected for the demo. I decided to add test cases as a demonstration of the methods working with a written walkthrough.\n",

    "When learning something for the first time we make mistakes. My mistake was posting a follow-up to an encrypted message that was the decoded unicode array of characters. This meant I was not responding via encrypted message! Professor Stade caught my mistake and I was able to correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Project\n",
    "For my custom project I decided to build a main function that takes user input to RSA methods. The goal was to implement self-checks for valid user inputs using math and data validation. I accomplish this in some methods like set_custom_primes, get_custom_n, and get_custom_e. In these methods I ask the user for specific inputs and validate against the known rules that apply for each. For instance, set_custom_n factorizes the value n to find p and q. If p or q are not prime then I ask the user to reinput a value n that is a multiple of two primes.\n",

    "What we can when n becomes 15-20 digits long is that the factorization slows down considerably. Although constructing large primes is easy, finding the factors of them is very difficult for modern computers. What makes RSA secure is the public key n length is usually over 200 digits, which is regarded as sufficient however in 2020 the largest publicly known factors RSA number had 250 digits [Wikipedia article](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem). However when talking about n is RSA we normally describe 2048-4096 bit sized numbers, 4096 being the most secure size [Wikipedia article](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem). These hundreds of digit long numbers take an extremely long time to factorize where the fastest algorithm has a complexity of 2<sup>number of bits in $n$</sup>, which if we using 4096 bit 2<sup>4096</sup> is a massive amount of bits. In fact there is no polynomial algorithms (eg O(n), O(n<sup>2</sup>)) that exists for factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our implementation of RSA is not very secure. We've only tested our RSA with smaller n values and data that has been shared between many users. Although in concept our RSA can be secure we have not built a systems that check for bit length or reused public keys. For instance, we are manually inputing small primes p, q which create n's which are no bigger than 50-100 bits. We should be enforcing primes that construct a number $n$ that is $2048 \\leq n \\leq 4096$ bits. Without this enforcement are not following best practices and are at risk of decryption. In addition, we should not use the same p's and q's when encrypting, we should always use unique primes so if the encryption is ever broken it can not be done to another message that we encrypt. Also our p and q should not equal each other, there does not look to be an instance where we check this condition. In addition, for small p and q there seems to be an issue with encoding and decoding. For example with 5, 11 when encoding 'Hello World!' I get back a bunch of special characters, a non-decoded version of 'Hello World! which can be seen below."

    "Below is the program to choose your own RSA adventure. In it I allow the user to Find Public Keys, Find Private Keys, Encode Messages, Decode Messages, and Break Codes. What I wanted to accomplish was a program that provided a lot of self-checks by doing the math to ensure what the user is providing is valid input. For instance, set_custom_primes gets numbers from the user but checks whether they are primes before setting the values to p and q. get_custom_n permits the user to enter an n value but checks whether that n is a multiple of two primes, if it is we ask for a new value. get_custom_e does something similar where given p and q is the e the user is providing relatively prime to (p-1)*(q-1). Along with math validation, I wanted to ensure a smooth process no matter the option the user chose. Therefore I check whether values are missing before calling a method. For instance, in options 2,3, and 4 I call setup methods to ensure the user has set all appropriate values before calling Encode or Decode. Overall, I hope this was more than the typical choose your own adventure type project by providing data validation and method prechecks. Something I could have done better is input valid with empty strings, non-integer strings, and special characters."
